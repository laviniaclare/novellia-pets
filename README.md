# Novellia Pets

This repository contains an extremely minimal proof of concept style implementation of Novellia Pets

## Getting started

To run the app you can run either `make dev` or `make run`, depending on whether or not you want to run it in dev mode. You should then be able to access the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

To run the tests run `make test`

## Tech Stack

I've chosen to use python with flask for this exercise. Why flask? The short, honest, answer is nostalgia. This was one of the first tech stacks I ever learned and it's been a while since I worked in it and I thought it might be fun to revisit it. Another reason is that python with flask is a nice simple framework that makes it pretty easy to get something basic up and running with minimal fuss. I also considered using nextjs for this because it is similarly great for getting something basic up and running quickly, but I was in a python mood

## Implementation Notes

## What I would change if this was a production app

- Django instead of Flask
- React with typescript instead of templates

## What I would like to do with more time
